## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a regression model to predict the prices of cars. Accurate price prediction can help buyers and sellers make informed decisions in the automobile market.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Car Price Prediction Dataset, which includes attributes such as mileage, age, and brand of the cars. The data preprocessing and cleaning steps are included to ensure the quality of the model.

## Features
- **Mileage**: The total distance a car has been driven.
- **Age**: The age of the car in years.
- **Brand**: The brand or manufacturer of the car.

## Model
The regression model uses Mini-Batch Gradient Descent for optimization and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the loss function. The model is trained to minimize the MAE, ensuring accurate predictions of car prices.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions without considering their direction.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bibhavcodeverse/Car_Price-_Pridiction.git
cd Car_Price-_Pridiction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can run the model training script:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

To make predictions using the trained model, use the prediction script:

```bash
python predict.py --input data/sample_input.csv --output data/predictions.csv
```
